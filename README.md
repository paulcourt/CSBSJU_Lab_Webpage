# CSBSJU_Lab_Webpage
Demo of useful skills for interview with CSB/SJU committee.

This quick moch up of a potential site for the CSB/SJU Computer Science Lab was generated from Dr. Miller's site and serves as an example of my capabilities as a web designer and shows creativity and my ability to adapt and apply my skills.
I hope to join the Computer Science Team and share their vision of excellence.
